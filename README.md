## FCC-Drum-Machine

This is a project written by Brandon Truong as part of the Front End Development Libraries certification with freeCodeCamp. 

This project simulates a drum set, including 9 different audio files corresponding to the button pressed. The buttons can be pressed via mouse or keyboard, and the corresponding drum type is displayed as well.
